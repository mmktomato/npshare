# npshare

Share a song or album you're currently playing on Spotify.

## Motivation

- There are many steps to share a song or an album from Spotify app.
- To find out "share" feature in Spotify app is annoying.
- An additional text that is automatically added when you're sharing an album from Spotify app is annoying.

## Development

Copy `.env.sample` and set it up.

```bash
$ cp .env.sample .env.local
```
